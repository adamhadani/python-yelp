Yelp API Python Client
----------------------

A simple, complete Yelp API client implementation in Python.

== Installing ==

To install, issue the following command:
  python setup.py install
  
This will install the package 'yelp' to your currently active
python site-packages repository.


== Example usage ==

from yelp import ReviewSearchApi
results = ReviewSearchApi(client_key=<my_key>, output="json").by_location("Mission, San Francisco CA")


results will be returned as a parsed python object. 
The exact format of returned result set is available 
at the Yelp API documentation page:

http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation

More verbose documentation of the various functionalities offered is made available
through-out the code using PyDoc.


== Release notes == 

- This software is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license

- Python 2.5 and above should be supported, however 2.6 is recommended.

- The only external dependency is on httplib2. If setuptools is installed,
  this should be automatically fetched and installed.

- To install, simply use:
	  python setup.py install

- The base HttpApiClient has a logger to enable debug logging of the URI's
  used. This might raise warning when a logging module basicConfig/fileConfig
  wasnt issued by the application. This has no effect but can be easily
  solved by importing logging module and using e.g:
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
  
- This package is *not* currently affiliated/endorsed by Yelp in any way.
